Text summarization is the process of distilling the most important information from a source text while preserving its meaning and key points. The goal of text summarization is to create a concise and coherent summary that provides an overview of the main ideas and arguments presented in the original text.
<br>
<br>
There are two main types of text summarization:
<br>
Extractive Summarization: This approach involves selecting and extracting existing sentences or phrases from the original text to form the summary. The selected sentences are usually the ones that contain the most important information or represent the main ideas. Extractive summarization does not generate new sentences; it relies on the content already present in the source text.
<br>
<br>
Abstractive Summarization: In contrast to extractive summarization, abstractive summarization involves generating new sentences that convey the essence of the original text. This process often requires a deeper understanding of the content and the ability to rephrase and restructure information. Abstractive summarization is more complex and challenging than extractive summarization because it involves a level of language generation.
<br>
<br>
There is another type of text summarizer which is called Hybrid Text Summarization:-<br>
 hybrid summarization  combines the precision of extractive methods (which ensure that the summary is based on actual content from the source) with the expressiveness of abstractive methods (which can generate more fluent and human-like summaries).
<br>
<br>
The goal of this project is to make all types of summaries and compare their accuracy.
